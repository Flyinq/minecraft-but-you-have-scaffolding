Minecraft But You Have Scaffolding

INFO: This is just a fun little datapack I made in my spare time. Basically it's just Minecraft but you have scaffolding all the time. It should be multiplayer compatible (not tested). If you decide to try this datapack I recommend you make a seperate world for this, as this will create a big mess and can break a lot of things.

RULES:
-If you die, run the command /reload.
-If someone joins after you have already started, run the command /function scaffold:start

HAVE FUN!
